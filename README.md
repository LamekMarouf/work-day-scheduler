# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler. It's purpose is for users to be able to record and set timestamps for certain hours of the workday. When you open the page, you are presented with a 9-5 hour schedule that displays the current time, and updates every second. The timeblocks are also color-coded to represent the past, present and future times; grey being past, red being present and green being future. You can type what you want to save for the hour on the left-hand side, and it shows what is going to be saved on the right-hand side. When the save button is pressed, the data is saved into local storage, so if the page were to be refreshed, the input that has been saved will remain there.
